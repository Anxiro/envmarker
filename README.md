We all know that is very common at least a 3 environments in our programming / IT projects (dev, staging, production). Generally they are all identical.
During these long years people has commited a lot of mistakes, in which we simply confuses environments and end up doing the procedures in wrong environments.
Who ever made that "little test" thinking it was doing in "dev" and suddenly realized he was in production. Also, it's no wonder. The environments are identical, except for discreet URL in the browser address bar. This situation is even more common when the application has an administrative interface.
With this in mind this extension for Google Chrome was developed, and makes it possible for you to configure the URLs of yours projects environments and puts a "huge label" on the top corner of the browser, identifying the environment for you with the color and name, according to what you have previously set.
